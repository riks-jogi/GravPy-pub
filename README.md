# GravPy-pub
Quick project to turn addresses or coodrinates into local gravitational forces using only the standard library.

## Important
You need an API key from https://developer.mapquest.com/.  
It's free :)

## Credits
Big thanks to my physics savvy friend Moyros for the gravity() function and the initial idea.
